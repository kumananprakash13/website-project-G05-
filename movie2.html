      <h2>Main Character</h2>
      <p><strong>Guido Orefice</strong> – a loving and optimistic father who uses humor and creativity to protect his son in a concentration camp.</p>

      <h2>Movie Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Life Is Beautiful (1997) is an Italian film set during World War II.
        Guido turns a tragic situation into a “game” to shield his son from the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp. His optimism and courage inspire hope even in the darkest times.

      <h2>Life Lesson Learned</h2>
      <p>
        The movie taught me that love, hope, and sacrifice are more powerful than fear. Even in extreme hardship, positivity and protecting others can make a life-changing difference.
